        <h1>How to make a cute Gingerbread Man!</h1>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>

        <ul>

        <li>225g plain flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
        <li>1 heaped tsp ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>50g unsalted butter</li>
        <li>100g soft brown sugar</li>
        <li>100g golden syrup</li>

        <ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Sieve the flour, salt, bicarb, ginger and cinnamon into a large bowl. Heat the butter, sugar and syrup until dissolved. Leave the sugar mixture to cool slightly, then mix into the dry ingredients to form a dough. Chill the dough in the fridge for 30 mins.</li>
                <li>On a surface lightly dusted with flour, roll out the dough to a ¼-inch thickness. Stamp out the gingerbread men shapes with a cutter, then re-roll any off-cuts and repeat. Place your gingerbread shapes on the lined trays, allowing space for them to spread. Cook for 10-15 mins, then remove from the oven and leave to cool.S</li>
